**Bagging**

This repository explores Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating), an ensemble learning technique aimed at improving model performance by combining multiple base models trained on bootstrapped datasets. It provides a detailed explanation of how bagging works, its strengths and limitations, and theoretical insights into its effectiveness.

**Key points**

1. The repository also delves into the basics of decision trees and the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm, which forms the basis for tree-based methods like bagging. A key component is splitting the feature space recursively to minimize prediction error.
2. An example of using bagging for a regression problem with the Bike Sharing dataset is provided. The effect of bagging on the modelâ€™s performance is compared with a basic linear regression model. The analysis shows that bagging performs poorly when there are uninformative predictors.
3. Various visualizations demonstrate how decision trees split the data, with an example of growing a tree on a Spotify dataset for predicting song popularity.
