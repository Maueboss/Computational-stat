	abstract = {Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple versions of a predictor and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.},

	abstract = {A new, minimally invasive procedure for female stress incontinence has recently been developed in which a prolene tape is placed without tension under mid-urethra, usually using local anaesthesia and mild sedation. Post-operative catheterisation is not employed. Forty-two women with urodynamically verified severe urinary stress incontinence were operated on in 1996 and 1997. They underwent subjective and objective follow-up in 1998 with mean follow-up time 16 months, range 6-27 months. The procedure was well tolerated. All patients except four (90.2%) were discharged within 24 hours. Subjectively, 85.4% were cured and a further 9.8% had slight incontinence only and used no protection. Objectively, 80.5% were cured and 12.2% were >90% improved. There were no cases of long term voiding problems, recurrent urinary tract infections, de novo urge incontinence, or sling rejections. With medium term follow-up this procedure appears to have good results and few complications.},
